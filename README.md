N-Oauth (Netazoic OAuth)

OAuth is easy (FBConnect), or a real pain (Linkedin)
In any event, using a library like Scribe is probably your best bet.
But even when using a library you have to write a few connectors to make
things work *the way you want them to*.

So this is me, writing a set of wrapper functions to make FBConnect and Linkedin (oauth 1.0) work in my programming environment. I use a thing we like to call CTP, which the rest of the world might call a clone of JSP version 1.0 or thereabouts. In any event, this is going to be of use, if any, to people coming from a Java servlets environment.

Cheers.
